# Calculator
![calculator preview](https://github.com/gabrielacepeda/Calculator/blob/master/calculator-image.png)

This calculator lets you do basic arithmetic. It functions as a normal calculator would with addtion, subtraction, multiplication and division. You can enter real numbers, as it allows decimal.

## How It's Made:
I intitially was going to build the calculator using a constructor function, but felt it was simpler using a class because under the hood it would be doing the same things, but with easier syntax.
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.


## Lessons Learned:
I'm trying to strengthen my OOP skills and this project pushed me into thinking like a developer, by breaking up tasks into smaller ones and finding new ways to do the same thing.
